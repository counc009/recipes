# COLLARDS AND BLACK EYED PEAS
## info
* About 30 minutes prep, 90 minutes total
* about 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 3 tablespoons butter (divided)
* 1 pound ground meat or vegetarian substitute
* Onion, finely diced
* 2 carrots, diced
* 4 ribs of celery, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced or crushed
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne (or to your preference)
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
* 2 bunches collard greens, de-veined, cut in half, and sliced lengthwise into
  1 inch wide ribbons
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1 can black eyed peas or 1.5 - 2 cups cooked black eyed peas

## steps  
1. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium
   heat. When hot, add the ground meat, using a wooden spoon to break it into
   small pieces. Stir regularly until cooked through.
1. Remove the ground meat using a slotted spoon into a bowl and set aside.
1. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the onion, carrots, and
   celery and continue stirring until softened. If the fond left in the pot
   threatens to burn, add a splash of water to keep it from burning.
1. Add garlic, paprika, and cayenne and continue stirring until fragrant, about
   30 seconds.
1. Deglaze the pot with the red wine vinegar, stir to scrape up the fond. Add
   the worcestershire and stir to combine.
1. Add the collards in batches, sprinkling with salt and pepper between each
   handful. Stir and let the collards wilt a little before adding the chicken
   stock.
1. Simmer for about 30 minutes with the lid partially on, stirring occasionally
   until the collards are darkened and softening but need a little more time to
   finish cooking. Taste midway for seasoning and adjust if desired.
1. Add the black eyed peas and continue cooking for another 10 minutes until
   the collards are dark green and soft and the bitter taste has been cooked
   off.
1. Add the ground meat to the pot and stir to combine.

## notes  
* For a vegetarian option, use a high quality vegetable stock in place of
  chicken stock.
* For a vegan option, use vegetable oil rather than butter.
