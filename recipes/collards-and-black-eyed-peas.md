# COLLARDS AND BLACK EYED PEAS
## info
* About 30 minutes prep, 90 minutes total
* about 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 2.5 tbsp vegetable oil (divided)
* 1 pack vegetarian chorizo (for instance Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo)
* Half an onion, finely diced
* 3 cloves garlic, diced or crushed
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/8 tsp ground cayenne (or to your preference)
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
* 2 bunches collard greens, de-veined, cut in half, and sliced lengthwise into
  1 inch wide ribbons
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
* 3 cups chicken stock
* 2 cans black eyed peas (with liquid)
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 roll of polenta, sliced thin

## steps  
1. Add 1.5 tablespoons of oil to a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium
   heat. When hot, add the chorizo, using a wooden spoon to break it into small
   pieces. Stir regularly until cooked through
1. Remove the chorizo using a slotted spoon into a bowl and set aside.
1. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and continue stirring
   until it begins to soften. If the fond left by the chorizo threatens to
   burn, add a splash of water to keep it from burning.
1. Add garlic, paprika, and cayenne and continue stirring until fragrant, about
   30 seconds.
1. Deglaze the pot with the reg wine vinegar, stir to scrape up the fond. Add
   the worcestershire and stir to combine.
1. Add the collards in batches, sprinkling with salt and pepper between each
   handful. Stir and let the collards wilt a little before adding the chicken
   stock. Cook for a minute or two so the collards are nearly covered by the
   stock. Add the beans and their liquid.
1. Simmer for about 40 minutes with the lid partially on, stirring occasionally
   until the collards are dark green and soft and the cooking liquid has
   reduced some. Taste midway for seasoning and adjust if desired.
1. Meanwhile, heat a saute pan over medium low heat, add enough butter to cover
   the bottom and add slices of the polenta, avoiding overcrowding. Cook,
   undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 3-5 minutes depending on
   thickness. Flip and cook until golden brown on both sides. Remove the
   slices onto a plate and set aside. Repeat for any remaining slices, adding
   additional butter to coat the bottom as needed.
1. Add the chorizo to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for about another 5
   minutes and then serve.

## notes  
* For a vegetarian option, use a high quality vegetable stock in place of
  chicken stock.
* For a vegan option, use vegetable oil rather than butter for frying the
  polenta.
