For the buttercream frosting:

* can of dulce de leche, divided
* pinch of kosher or sea salt

## steps
For the caramel syrup:
1. Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a small heavy bottom saucepan over
   medium heat. Stir slightly if needed to dissolve sugar, but do not stir once
   the sugar has melted.
1. Cook until the syrup has a dark amber color.
1. Add the remaining 1/2 cup water slowly while stirring constantly, continue
   cooking to darken and thicken slightly.
1. Remove from heat, transfer to a heatproof container and let cool.

For the cake:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F about 20 minutes before you intend to bake the cake.
1. Grease and line with parchment paper two 9 inch round cake pans.
1. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt and set aside.
1. Combine milk and butter in a heatproof container and microwave for about 2
   minutes to melt the butter and heat the milk. Do not let the milk boil,
   though bubbling is fine. Cover and leave in the microwave to stay warm.
1. In a large bowl, beat the eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6.
1. Over the next 45 seconds continue beating and slowly sprinkling in the
   sugar.
1. Increase the beater to speed 8 and continue beating for 2 minutes.
1. Over the next minute add the caramel syrup in thirds, continuing to beat.
1. Mix for another 4 minutes and then stop beating.
1. Add a third of the flour, and beat on speed 1 for 5 seconds. Add the next
   third and beat for another 5 seconds and finally add the last third and beat
   for 5 to 10 seconds until the flour is fully incorporated.
1. Pour the milk and butter into a larger bowl, add the vanilla extract and
   vegetable oil, and about 1.5 cups of the egg batter into the milk mixture.
   Whisk vigorously until smooth.
1. Slowly add the milk mixture to the egg batter over the next 15 seconds,
   mixing on speed 1.
1. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix for another 5 to 10 seconds
   so the batter is smooth and pourable.
1. Divide evenly into the prepared cake pans and bake for about 26 minutes.

For the frosting:
1. Cream the butter, and then slowly add 2 cups of the confectioner's sugar,
   continuing to mix.
1. Add 1/8 cup cream and the vanila extract and mix for a few seconds before
   adding half the dulce de leche. Mix well.
1. Add the remaining cream and stir briefly.
1. Add the remaining dulce de leche and mix until blended.
1. Add a pinch of salt and begin slowly adding up to another 2 cups of
   confectioner's sugar until the frosting reaches the desired consistency.
1. Mix on medium speed for another 4 minutes until the frosting is spreadable.

For preparation:
1. When the cakes are done, remove from oven and cool in the pans for 15
   minutes.
1. Gently turn them out onto cooling racks, cooling upside down to help flatten
   the dome. Let cool.
1. Frost with the buttercream frosting.
