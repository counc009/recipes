# COLLARDS WITH PEANUTS
## info  
* About 30 minutes prep, 75 minutes total
* about 6 servings

## ingredients
* 1.5 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1 bunch scallions/green onions, sliced thin, greens and whites divided
* 1 tablespoon crushed garlic (about 3 medium cloves)
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger or ginger paste
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or to your preference)
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon peanut butter
* 2 bunches collard greens, de-veined, cut in half, and sliced lengthwise into
  1 inch wide ribbons
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 2 cups boiled peanuts (see notes)

## steps
1. Add the oil to a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium heat.
1. Once hot, add the scallion whites and stir until beginning to brown. Add the
   scallion greens and continue stirring until the greens are slightly browned.
1. Add garlic, ginger, lemon zest, and red pepper flake and continue stirring
   until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
1. Deglaze the pot with the vinegar, it should quickly reach a boil and stir
   slightly until it reduces into a thick sauce consistency. Then, add the soy
   sauce and peanut butter, and continue cooking until the liquid has reduced
   into a sauce; you should be able to drag a spatula through the sauce
   and leave a trail for several seconds.
1. Add the collards in batches, sprinkling with salt between each batch. Stir
   and let the collards wilt until everything is either bright green or dark
   green.
1. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Add the peanuts.
1. Simmer for about 45 minutes with the lid an inch or two off, stirring
   occasionally until the collards are dark green and soft and the cooking
   liquid has reduced some. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off
   heat.
1. Serve hot. See below for serving suggestions.

## notes  
* To make about 2 cups of boiled peanuts, take about 3/4 pounds of raw in-shell
  peanuts. Add about 6 cups water, 2 tablespoons table salt, 2 tablespoons
  paprika, and the peanuts to a pot. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 2-3 hours
  or more, until they reach the desired consistency (I would recommend keeping
  them just slightly firm, they will cook a little more with the collards). Let
  cool and shell.
* For a vegetarian or vegan option, use a high quality vegetable stock in place
  of chicken stock.

* Serving Suggestions
  - Bake two sweet potatoes, cut into thick slices, and serve in the stew.
  - Roast cubed potatoes at 425 until crisp, and serve on top of the stew.
  - Serve with thick sliced bread.
