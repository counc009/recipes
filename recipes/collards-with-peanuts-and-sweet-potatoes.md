# COLLARDS WITH PEANUTS AND SWEET POTATOES
## info  
* About 30 minutes prep, 75 minutes total
* about 6 servings

## ingredients
* 1.5 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1 bunch scallions/green onions, sliced thin, greens and whites divided
* 1 tablespoon crushed garlic (about 3 medium cloves)
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger or ginger paste
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or to your preference)
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon peanut butter
* 2 bunches collard greens, de-veined, cut in half, and sliced lengthwise into
  1 inch wide ribbons
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 2 cups boiled peanuts (see notes)
* 2 medium sweet potatoes
* 1/2 cup dry roast peanuts (optional)

## steps
1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.
1. Add the oil to a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium heat.
1. Once hot, add the scallion whites and stir until beginning to brown. Add the
   scallion greens and continue stirring until the greens are slightly browned.
1. Add garlic, ginger, lemon zest, and red pepper flake and continue stirring
   until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
1. Deglaze the pot with the vinegar, it should quickly reach a boil and stir
   slightly until it reduces into a thick sauce consistency. Then, add the soy
   sauce and peanut butter, and continue cooking until the liquid has reduced
   into a sauce; you should be able to drag a spatula through the sauce
   and leave a trail for several seconds.
1. Add the collards in batches, sprinkling with salt between each batch. Stir
   and let the collards wilt until everything is either bright green or dark
   green.
1. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Add the peanuts.
1. Simmer for about 45 minutes with the lid an inch or two off, stirring
   occasionally until the collards are dark green and soft and the cooking
   liquid has reduced some. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off
   heat.
1. Meanwhile, place the sweet potatoes in the oven and bake for about 45
   minutes, until a fork poked in can reach the center with little or no
   resistance.
1. Cut the sweet potatoes into thick slices (one for each serving). Place into
   bowls and add the collard and peanuts stew. Optionally add dry roast
   peanuts. Serve hot.

## notes  
* To make about 2 cups of boiled peanuts, take about 3/4 pounds of raw in-shell
  peanuts. Add about 6 cups water, 2 tablespoons table salt, 2 tablespoons
  paprika, and the peanuts to a pot. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 2-3 hours
  or more, until they reach the desired consistency (I would recommend keeping
  them just slightly firm, they will cook a little more with the collards). Let
  cool and shell.
* For a vegetarian or vegan option, use a high quality vegetable stock in place
  of chicken stock.
