# BRAISED CAULIFLOWER
## info  
* About 30 minutes prep, 120 minutes total
* about 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 3 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
* head of cauliflower cut into quarters
* salt and pepper to taste
* 2 medium yellow onions, diced
* 4 medium carrots, chopped
* 4 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger
* 2 teaspoons sweet curry powder
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* pinch of red pepper flakes
* splash of white cooking wine
* 24 oz fingerling potatoes, halved
* about 4 cups chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons corn starch
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

## steps  
1. Preheat over to 350Â°F
1. Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a dutch oven or other oven-safe pot
   over medium heat.
1. Sprinkle the cauliflower quarters with salt and pepper on the cut sides.
1. Once the pot is hot, add the cauliflower quarters and sear for about 5
   minutes, undisturbed. Flip the pieces onto the other cut side and sear for
   about another 5 minutes. Adjust the temperature if needed to avoid burning.
   Remove the cauliflower from the pot.
1. Add the onion and carrots, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Sautee
   until softened and the onions are lightly browned.
1. Clear space in the middle of the pot and add the garlic, ginger, curry
   powder, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Sautee until aromatic and then mix
   into the onion and carrots.
1. Deglaze with the wine and scrape any fond off the bottom of the pot.
1. Add the potatoes, and then nestle the cauliflower pieces onto them. Add the
   chicken stock to cover about half to three quarters of the way up the
   cauliflower.
1. Bring to a low simmer and then cover and transfer to the oven and cook for
   45 minutes.
1. Remove from oven, and remove the cauliflower and potatoes into a separate
   bowl. Place over medium heat and bring to a lively simmer. Remove about
   1/2 a cup of the liquid into a heat-proof cup and whisk in the corn starch.
   Pour this slurry back in, and mix together. Taste for seasoning and adjust
   as needed.
1. When the sauce has reduced slightly and clings to a spoon but still drips
   off slowly, turn off the heat and mix in the tablespoon of butter.
