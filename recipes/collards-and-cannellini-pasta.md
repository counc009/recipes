# COLLARDS AND CANNELLINI PASTA
## info  
* About 30 minutes prep, 90 minutes total
* about 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 2 cups dried pasta (for instance small shells or orecchiette)
* 4 cups chicken stock, divided
* 6 tablespoons butter, divided
* 1 shallot, diced
* 1 tablespoon garlic, diced or crushed
* 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or to your preference)
* 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup white cooking wine
* 2 bunches collard greens, de-veined, cut in half, and sliced lengthwise into
  1 inch wide ribbons
* 1 can cannellini beans, drained
* 2-3 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste
* about 1/3 cup pine nuts (or other nut pieces, for instance sliced almonds)
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## steps  
1. When beginning to cook, soak pasta in 1.5 cups of the chicken stock, adding
   water to cover with enough room to stir. Stir this periodically throughout
   cooking.
1. Add 4 tablespoons butter to a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium
   heat. Stir constantly until browned.
1. Add the shallot and continue stirring until slightly browned, this should
   happen relatively rapidly. Note that the brown butter will bubble up
   intensely.
1. Add garlic and red pepper flake and continue stirring until fragrant and the
   garlic is slightly browned.
1. Deglaze the pot with the white wine vinegar, it should quickly reach a boil.
   Add the white wine and cook, stirring regularly, until the liquid has
   reduced into a sauce; you should be able to drag a spatula through the sauce
   and leave a trail for a few seconds. The vinegar should mellow in this
   process and the sauce should have a bright flavor.
1. Add the collards in batches, sprinkling with salt and pepper between each
   batch. Stir and let the collards wilt a little before adding the remaining
   2.5 cups of chicken stock. Cook for a minute or two so the collards are
   nearly covered by the stock. Add the drained beans.
1. Simmer for about 40 minutes with the lid partially on, stirring occasionally
   until the collards are dark green and soft and the cooking liquid has
   reduced some. Taste for seasoning and adjust if desired.
1. While the collards and beans are simmering, toast the nuts in a pan with a
   tablespoon of butter.
1. Add the soaked pasta and the soaking liquid to the pot, scrapping as much
   starch as possible into the pot. Bring to a boil and cook until the pasta
   is al dente (this should occur very quickly).
1. Turn off the heat, add the remaining tablespoon of butter, the grated
   Parmesan cheese, and the nuts. Stir until the butter has melted.

## notes  
* For a vegetarian option, use a high quality vegetable stock in place of
  chicken stock.
* For a vegan option, use another fat (or multiple fats) of your choice in
  place of butter. The temperatures of this recipe are sufficiently low that
  any fat should work; when using fat wait for it to shimmer and the fat should
  sputter as soon as the shallots are added. Replace the Parmesan cheese with
  a vegan alternative or leave out entirely.
